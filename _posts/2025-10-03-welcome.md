Hello! I'm Jamie Nam, and I'm excited to share my research notes and projects with you.

Over time, I'll post updates on my work in digital health, humanâ€“computer interaction (HCI), and information systems. I hope this site becomes a helpful resource for students, collaborators, and anyone curious about these fields.

Thanks for visiting, and stay tuned for more!
